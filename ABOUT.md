# About this project

This is one of those projects that started out as a bit of fun escapism and got a bit out of hand. Anyway, I'll try to describe some of the ideas behind it and where it might (or might not) go in the future.

## Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to this project then your kindness and generosity knows no bounds. That said, I have no idea if or when I might have any more time to spend on this project. Life and work have a habit of getting in the way of amusing oneself. I'm afraid there's a good chance I will be a poor collaborator. I may not respond to issues, comments or pull requests for weeks, months or even ever. I humbly beg your forgiveness in advance. That said, if you're still interested in contributing, then please go for it. Meeting new people is one of the great pleasures of open source. 

One more thing. This project is quite different from anything I've done before, because it's artistic rather than technical. I'm not trying to solve a problem, rather I'm trying to create a particular kind of experience. What I've learned from this project is that the creative journey is long, winding and surprising. Ideas lead to ideas which lead to more ideas. Where you end up is generally a very long way from where you started. The original idea may even seem to be completely lost. But every idea is valuable and part of the creative process. And a lot of patience is required, because ideas can take time to arrive or unfold. So all ideas are good ideas, however bizarre, crazy, silly or unusual. And most ideas are stepping stones to other ideas, so be prepared to leave ideas behind and enjoy where they lead you!

## Concept

If I had to sum up what this project is in a few words, I would say it is a piece of lo-fi experimental interactive computational amateur dramatics. Or a silly game. Basically, it's a bit of fun. I'm enjoying making it, and maybe one or two people might enjoy playing it. 

The starting point for this game was the question, what would it be like to create a game where all user interaction happened via Python code? In other words, the player uses only Python code to control the game. Why would anyone ask this question? I have no idea.

In truth, there was another question at the very beginning, and that was: what are the skills and abilities that make someone a really good programmer, and can those be developed through teaching or training, if so how? But that question has got so lost in the nonsense that followed I think it's best to forget anyone ever asked it.

## Game structure

The game is organised into acts, each of which is divided into scenes. Each scene is a mini-game which can be played in isolation. However, there is an overarching plot (story) which threads through all scenes and provides the link from one scene to the next.

## Plot

The main character is ADA, which stands for Artifical Dramatic Actor. ADA is a prototype program created in the early 1980s with the goal of creating the first artifical actor who has emotional capabilities and could play dramatic roles on the theatre stage. ADA was created by a team of programmers ("the creators") who were passionate about computing, theatre, comedy and open source. However, ADA was never completed or released and has remained as a prototype running on a single computer for 40 years.

In the early 1990s when Python was first released, the creators got very excited about the new programming language and decided to integrate ADA with Python to augment the interactive user experience. They also decided to create a training course in Python programming. They also connected ADA to the internet, making it possible for anyone to find and interact with her. But they quickly realised that although they were good programmers themselves, they had no idea how to teach programming to anyone else. So the project was abandoned, but they forgot to disconnect ADA from the internet.

You (the player) have now stumbled on the website they created to host the training course and provide a connection to ADA. Through the website you can connect to the old personal computer that ADA has been running on since the 1980s and interact with her.

To be continued.
